    I'm designing an authentication system for our web application. I plan to use JWT tokens 
    stored in localStorage with a 24-hour expiration. The authentication flow will be:
    1. User enters credentials
    2. Server validates and returns JWT
    3. Frontend stores token in localStorage
    4. Token is included in Authorization header for API calls
    
    This approach is simple to implement and works well with our React frontend.

    üë®‚Äçüíª DEVELOPER's CRITIQUE:
    The authentication approach covers the basic flow, but has several technical limitations:
    
    1. Storing JWTs in localStorage is accessible to JavaScript, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks
    2. There's no mention of token refresh strategy - what happens when tokens expire?
    3. Error handling isn't addressed - how will authentication failures be managed?
    4. The implementation doesn't consider scalability with multiple services or microservices
    5. There's no consideration of performance impact of including tokens in every request
    
    Alternative approaches worth considering:
    - Using HTTP-only cookies for token storage to mitigate XSS risks
    - Implementing a token refresh mechanism
    - Considering a centralized auth service if using microservices

    SYNTHESIS OF PERSPECTIVES:
    
    After considering both the Developer and Security Expert perspectives, several important issues have been identified with the original authentication approach.
    
    BLIND SPOTS IDENTIFIED:
    1. XSS vulnerability with localStorage token storage
    2. No token refresh mechanism
    3. No HTTPS enforcement
    4. Excessive token lifetime
    5. No CSRF protection
    6. No error handling strategy
    7. Scalability concerns with microservices
    
    CONTRADICTIONS FOUND:
    None - both perspectives identified complementary issues
    
    CONFIDENCE: Low
    
    CHANGES NEEDED: Yes
    
    RECOMMENDATION:
    The authentication system requires significant security improvements before implementation:
    
    1. Use HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage to store tokens
    2. Implement HTTPS across all endpoints
    3. Reduce token lifetime to 1 hour and implement a refresh token mechanism
    4. Add CSRF protection when using cookies
    5. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
    6. Add comprehensive error handling
    7. Consider centralized authentication if using microservices
    
    This revised approach balances security requirements with development considerations.
