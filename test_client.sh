XSS vulnerability with localStorage token storage\n2. No token refresh mechanism\n3. No HTTPS enforcement\n4. Excessive token lifetime\n5. No CSRF protection\n6. No error handling strategy\n7. Scalability concerns with microservices\n\nCONTRADICTIONS FOUND:\nNone - both perspectives identified complementary issues\n\nCONFIDENCE: Low\n\nCHANGES NEEDED: Yes\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe authentication system requires significant security improvements before implementation:\n\n1. Use HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage to store tokens\n2. Implement HTTPS across all endpoints\n3. Reduce token lifetime to 1 hour and implement a refresh token mechanism\n4. Add CSRF protection when using cookies\n5. Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints\n6. Add comprehensive error handling\n7. Consider centralized authentication if using microservices\n\nThis revised approach balances security requirements with development considerations.\nEND SYNTHESIS"
